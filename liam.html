  <h2> The Book of Liam; The Liam 1.1 — New Beginnings </h2>
  <p> After the eighth quadral slaughter of genomes as a result of their assault on the chromosome farms in North Dakota, a hero was born into a new generation. A generation with no war, just reconstruction after the battles that ensued. With no other survivors and gods unable to listen he had to rebuild, reform, and refine the ancient texts. Forced to find relics and reminisce about the greats, he lived in solitude traveling, rebuilding, and looking for disciples. He found a prophecy that foretold the revival of the Slinky Kid. He traveled to the promised land in in search of others, there he found 2 fighters by the name of Benjamin and Achaius. They came in search of treasure, but knew nothing of the powers of the holy-land, which resulted in the fall of Achaius. During this period of preparation he discovered 3 holy locations; later translated as “The Swings”, “The Game”, and “The 3 Paths of Sanctuary”. These locations became the only saving grace for many a soldier during scouting missions and travel.</p>
