<h1><strong><em>The Commandments</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong><em>Current fort cleanup standards:&nbsp;</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>The biggest tarp is laid out below the items which are then covered by the two smaller tarps. This is then followed by the camouflage.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong><em> Thou shall listen to those above them in rank and grade in terms of rules.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Freshmen = 1 Sophomores =2 Juniors =3 Seniors = 4</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Liam = V Founders = IV Investors = III Disciples = II Trusted Person = I</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>It takes more points than the opposing &ldquo;group&rdquo; to win an argument over rules.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>EX: Two sophomores want to add a rule 2 Juniors are against. They are all disciple rank. The Juniors overrule because their point count is higher.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>II</em></strong><strong><em> Do not drink/use all the soda/other utilities/food. Seniors and Juniors have special permissions for this if they want.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>III</em></strong><strong><em> Commandments can be removed and added over and under 10 if so needed.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>IV </em></strong><strong><em>Only Founders and above can write in the Slug.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>V</em></strong><strong><em> The fort must be cleaned up and put back in the newest standard before leaving unless of an emergency.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>VI</em></strong><strong><em> For a rule to be finalized every founding member + Liam must agree.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>VII</em></strong><strong><em> Those of equal rank shall refer to lowest direct point value applied to them to settle disputes.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>EX: Two founders are having a dispute (III=III) one is a sophomore (2) the other is a freshmen (1). Although III=III 2 is greater than 1 so the sophomore shall have the power.</em></p>

<h1><strong><em>The Founders</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong><em>The Book Of Julian; The Founders 1.1 &mdash; The Battle of the Chromosomes (1030 B.SK.)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Many years ago a battle was unfolding. A Great War, Slinky Kid vs the boomers. The boomers had just harnessed the power of nuclear weaponry and the slinkians had to do something. The leader known as Slinky Kid was fighting on the front lines during the war. When we were losing he did something very brave. He sacrificed one of his chromosomes for our sake. Many slinkians died that day but in the end it was a success. We defeated the boomers and won the battle. Slinky kids soul ascended to the Genesis and his body now stays here on earth.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Julian; The Founders 1.2 &mdash; Slug</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Many years after the events of the Chromosome wars the Founders came across a snake. While trying to capture it in an attempt to make a mere pet they saw that this was no average snake. This snake had been living since the wars began. When slinky kid sacrificed the chromosome, the snake was near the area and some of the energy from the ordeal was manifested into the snake, granting it eternal life. After the Founders discovered him one of the founders was given a vision upon physical contact. The founders respectively named it Slug. However after less than 4 hours Slug got away. The founders decided to see Slug as a holy symbol. (See Fig 1 500 A.SK.)</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Julian; The Founders 1.3 &mdash; Ghosts 1 (Oct 8, 2019)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>At the fort certain founders have described hearing footsteps and running continuously for certain visits. They even went as far as to say that they describe seeing people hiding in the distances.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Julian; The Founders 1.4 &mdash; Ghosts 2 (Oct 9, 2019)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>After another founder and I stayed at the game on Oct 9 2,019 A.SK I counted 11 squirts left in the cooler. The other Founders and The Liam then drank 5-6 later that day but mentioned there only being one left in the cooler after that. Mathematically this doesn&rsquo;t work out as there would be 4-5 more. However at the time of this being written there is one. It is especially suspicious that we heard footsteps and walking repeatedly the same day near the base.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Gideon; The Founders 2.1 &mdash; Possession</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>When the evil poured out of the ExAntiChrist that fateful day at the bridge, it flowed into a new host: Noah. Noah was a ghostly spirit with a strange obsession with me. I was possessed, followed around everywhere until I reached the road, where the ghoul would sharply turn and leave. I decided to use this unearthly curse to my advantage, determined to learn everything I could about the new AntiChrist.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Dawson; The Founders 3.1 &mdash; Preparations (Oct 10, 2019)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Today was a great day in which many things came together for the oncoming unveiling of The Game. I have made contributions of $42 to the preparations. We used that money to buy food and drinks. The first $25 was used at one of the most expensive stores. The other $17 was used to buy 48 sodas. All the food and drink was brought to The Game. The Liam The Founders rendezvoused at The Game to prep for the oncoming &ldquo;barbecue&rdquo; we cleaned off the snow and organized our supplies. I believe the barbecue will go great.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Riley; The founders 4.1- afterlife&nbsp;</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>The birth of abraham sparked a flash of enormous energy creating slinky kid, once slinky kid was formed he knew he had to become something great. After the chromosome war the fort was in deep sorrow. When slinky kid spared his chromosome his beyond crippled body remained but his soul rose to the Squirt. The Squirt is the afterlife of </em></p>
<h1><strong><em>The Liam</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Liam; The Liam 1.1 &mdash; New Beginnings</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>After the eighth quadral slaughter of genomes as a result of their assault on the chromosome farms in North Dakota, a hero was born into a new generation. A generation with no war, just reconstruction after the battles that ensued. With no other survivors and gods unable to listen he had to rebuild, reform, and refine the ancient texts. Forced to find relics and reminisce about the greats, he lived in solitude traveling, rebuilding, and looking for disciples. He found a prophecy that foretold the revival of the Slinky Kid. He traveled to the promised land in in search of others, there he found 2 fighters by the name of Benjamin and Achaius. They came in search of treasure, but knew nothing of the powers of the holy-land, which resulted in the fall of Achaius. During this period of preparation he discovered 3 holy locations; later translated as &ldquo;The Swings&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Game&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The 3 Paths of Sanctuary&rdquo;. These locations became the only saving grace for many a soldier during scouting missions and travel.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Liam; The Liam 1.2 &mdash; Saints Assembly&nbsp;</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>After a year of searching, he came across 2 new travelers, an undeniable evil and an unknown leader. As did the last two, these two travelers came in search of splendor only to find a decrepit wasteland. The hero told the travelers about the prophecies and his plan to make an army of &ldquo;Chromes&rdquo; to fight along Slinky Kid during his second coming.</em></p>
<h1><strong><em>The Investors</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong><em>The Investors 1.1 &mdash; Notes I</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Bro, that&rsquo;s the classical face of most New York women. They are either angry (at CIS white men) or on Xanax (deadpan face). It&rsquo;s the new progressive world.</em></p>
<h1><strong><em>The ExAntiChrist</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Dawson; The ExAntiChrist 1.1 &mdash; Origins</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>The world was in ruins after the chromosome war. The anti-Christ was attempting to take control of the war torn nation. He forced people to blindly follow in his ways. They did as told, many a time disregarding the teachings of our Lord and Savior Slinky Kid. The AntiChrist wreaked havoc on society. His only plans were to be better and greater than all. He stopped the Slinky Kid army from recovering after the chromosome war. Without a leader to lead them the army fell into disarray. Luckily the boomers were defeated. Had the boomers still been fighting they would have destroyed all the followers of Slinky Kid. This was a great turning point in the history of Slinkians.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Dawson; The ExAntiChrist 1.2 &mdash; Changes&nbsp;</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>The AntiChrist had taken over with little resistance. It all changed when a search of the promised land revealed the strongest followers of Slinky Kid. The new found Slinkian strength destroyed the power of the AntiChrist. He moved back to following the ways of Slinky Kid. This change of ways was kickstarted by a strange black couch found near the battle site of the chromosome war. The power of Slinky Kid had spread through the land when he sacrificed his chromosome. The AntiChrist moved the couch into the river and was purified of evil. He became a founder and the ExAntiChrist.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Dawson; The ExAntiChrist 1.3 &mdash; Rebirth</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>The world can never be so imbalanced as to have only good or only evil. When the AntiChrist was purified it brought imbalance to the world. The good was too strong. It is a sad thing that there can be too much good but there was. The balance was soon to be restored by the new AntiChrist who had secretly been becoming more and more evil. With the new evil arising something needed to be done. No plans had yet been made but a great observation occurred. That observation may prove to be the savior of The Game.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Noah; The ExAntiChrist 2.1 &mdash; Observations</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>We could not be so fortunate as to have the new AntiChrist, Noah, not cross the road. It truly was intriguing. As the founders and The Liam were running to The Game with a new disciple Noah followed. The Liam kept running with the new disciple whilst the other founders hid waiting to see what Noah would do. As he neared the road all seemed lost. Suddenly, as if an invisible force was controlling him Noah turned around and left the founders be. This may protect The Game for a long time to come.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>The Book of Noah; The ExAntiChrist 2.2 &mdash; Observations 2 (Oct 10, 2019)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Strangely enough nothing new transpired with Noah today. I wonder if he is planning something. I do recall however that Noah acted very strange when invited to the barbecue. It&rsquo;s probably nothing though.</em></p>
<h1><strong><em>Timeline:</em></strong></h1>
<p><em>The beginning:</em><em> in the beginning dinosaurs and the ancients lived in harmony farming chromosomes. They used these chromosomes to create giant mythical beasts to protect other chromosome springs.</em></p>
<p><em>Powers of the ancients:</em><em> during this time the ancients created many ancient relics that served as storage containers for thousands of chromosomes, they hid these relics all around the earth, although only one has been found to this day.</em></p>
<p><em>Humanity begins:</em><em> tragedy struck the ancients when a meteor from outer space crashed onto earth's surface, only a handful of ancients survived. Soon humans came to be.</em></p>
<p><em>The great prosperity:</em><em> eons passed as the remaining ancients guided humans through evolution, through the leadership of the ancients humans were able to create great monuments such as the pyramids, Stonehenge, and colonize Easter island.</em></p>
<p><em>Boomer&rsquo;s rebellion:</em><em> after all the ancients had done for them humans only wanted more, they began to militarize against the ancients with the creation of nuclear devices. Boomers attacked the ancients who had congregated in Japan, after two nukes only one of the five had survived.</em></p>
<p><em>Assaults on the chromosome farms:</em><em> the remaining followers of the ancients came to the aid of the weakened &ldquo;Slinky Kid&rdquo;. They raided the ancient chromosome farms that were captured by the Boomers, many followers perished but after the eighth assault the followers found one of the chromosome relics.</em></p>
<p><em>Final force:</em><em> using a relic slinky kid was restored, he sacrificed his mind chromosome (His most important chromosome), in order to defeat the Boomers. In a giant explosion he disappeared. (See more: Book of Julian)</em></p>
<p><em>Pendulum wars:</em><em> inspired by the brave act of heroism of &ldquo;Slinky Kid&rdquo; followers we&rsquo;re revitalized with a new fight. Little did they know &ldquo;Slinky Kid&rdquo; was the only force holding back an evil darkness. During these years there was a constant battle between the followers and the darkness, the battlegrounds marred the face of the earth, almost destroying all of humanity.</em></p>
<p><em>Descent into destruction:</em><em> the followers were unable to stop the darkness and the world plunged into darkness. The followers had all died and the ancient texts were the only memory of a lost time.</em></p>
<p><em>A saint is born:</em><em> from the ashes a saint was born. (See more: Book of Liam)</em></p>
<p><em>Reconstruction of the ancients:</em><em> the saint began to rebuild from the rubble of the pendulum wars. (See more: Book of Liam)</em></p>
<p><em>Fall of Achaius:</em><em> this marks the fall of one of the greatest fighters of slink-kind. (See more: Book of Liam)</em></p>
<p><em>Prophecy of the slink:</em><em> the saint at this point found the prophecy that foretold the second coming of &ldquo;Slinky Kid&rdquo;. (See more: Book of Liam)</em></p>
