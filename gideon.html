  <h2> The Book of Gideon; The Founders 2.1 â€” Possession </h2>
  <p> When the evil poured out of the ExAntiChrist that fateful day at the bridge, it flowed into a new host: Noah. Noah was a ghostly spirit with a strange obsession with me. I was possessed, followed around everywhere until I reached the road, where the ghoul would sharply turn and leave. I decided to use this unearthly curse to my advantage, determined to learn everything I could about the new AntiChrist.
