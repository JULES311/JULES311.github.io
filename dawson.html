  <h2> The Book of Dawson; The Founders 3.1 — Preparations (Oct 10, 2019) </h2>
  <p> Today was a great day in which many things came together for the oncoming unveiling of The Game. I have made contributions of $42 to the preparations. We used that money to buy food and drinks. The first $25 was used at one of the most expensive stores. The other $17 was used to buy 48 sodas. All the food and drink was brought to The Game. The Liam The Founders rendezvoused at The Game to prep for the oncoming “barbecue” we cleaned off the snow and organized our supplies. I believe the barbecue will go great.
