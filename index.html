Current fort cleanup standards: 
The biggest tarp is laid out below the items which are then covered by the two smaller tarps. This is then followed by the camouflage.
I Thou shall listen to those above them in rank and grade in terms of rules.
Freshmen = 1 Sophomores =2 Juniors =3 Seniors = 4
Liam = V Founders = IV Investors = III Disciples = II Trusted Person = I
It takes more points than the opposing “group” to win an argument over rules.
EX: Two sophomores want to add a rule 2 Juniors are against. They are all disciple rank. The Juniors overrule because their point count is higher.
II Do not drink/use all the soda/other utilities/food. Seniors and Juniors have special permissions for this if they want.
III Commandments can be removed and added over and under 10 if so needed.
IV Only Founders and above can write in the Slug.
V The fort must be cleaned up and put back in the newest standard before leaving unless of an emergency.
VI For a rule to be finalized every founding member + Liam must agree.
VII Those of equal rank shall refer to lowest direct point value applied to them to settle disputes.
EX: Two founders are having a dispute (III=III) one is a sophomore (2) the other is a freshmen (1). Although III=III 2 is greater than 1 so the sophomore shall have the power.
VIII To approve an amendment to the finalized commandments ALL Founders and Liam must approve. </pre>
