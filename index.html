			<p>The Slug is the New Testament to the Slinkian Religion, written by the prophets to show the commonwealth the reality that they cannot see. This text is an adaptation of the writings of Scylax one of the last prophets of the treaty of 24 kingdoms. The contents of this book is a ploy from the last remaining of our race, in order to restore a lost religion, we beg you to believe, for the truth may restore your lost soul.</p>
