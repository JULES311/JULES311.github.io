  <h1> The Book Of Julian; The Founders 1.1 — The Battle of the Chromosomes (1030 B.SK.) </h1>
  <p> Many years ago a battle was unfolding. A Great War, Slinky Kid vs the boomers. The boomers had just harnessed the power of nuclear weaponry and the slinkians had to do something. The leader known as Slinky Kid was fighting on the front lines during the war. When we were losing he did something very brave. He sacrificed one of his chromosomes for our sake. Many slinkians died that day but in the end it was a success. We defeated the boomers and won the battle. Slinky kids soul ascended to the Genesis and his body now stays here on earth.

  <h1> The Book of Julian; The Founders 1.2  — Slug </h1>
  <p>Many years after the events of the Chromosome wars the Founders came across a snake. While trying to capture it in an attempt to make a mere pet they saw that this was no average snake. This snake had been living since the wars began. When slinky kid sacrificed the chromosome, the snake was near the area and some of the energy from the ordeal was manifested into the snake, granting it eternal life. After the Founders discovered him one of the founders was given a vision upon physical contact. The founders respectively named it Slug. However after less than 4 hours Slug got away. The founders decided to see Slug as a holy symbol. (See Fig 1 500 A.SK.)

  <h1> The Book of Julian; The Founders 1.3  — Ghosts 1 (Oct 8, 2019) </h1>
  <p>At the fort certain founders have described hearing footsteps and running continuously for certain visits. They even went as far as to say that they describe seeing people hiding in the distances.

  <h1> The Book of Julian; The Founders 1.4 — Ghosts 2 (Oct 9, 2019) </h1>
<p> After another founder and I stayed at the game on Oct 9 2,019 A.SK I counted 11 squirts left in the cooler. The other Founders and The Liam then drank 5-6 later that day but mentioned there only being one left in the cooler after that. Mathematically this doesn’t work out as there would be 4-5 more. However at the time of this being written there is one. It is especially suspicious that we heard footsteps and walking repeatedly the same day near the base.
