  <h2> The Book of Dawson; The ExAntiChrist 1.1 — Origins </h2>
  <p> The world was in ruins after the chromosome war. The anti-Christ was attempting to take control of the war torn nation. He forced people to blindly follow in his ways. They did as told, many a time disregarding the teachings of our Lord and Savior Slinky Kid. The AntiChrist wreaked havoc on society. His only plans were to be better and greater than all. He stopped the Slinky Kid army from recovering after the chromosome war. Without a leader to lead them the army fell into disarray. Luckily the boomers were defeated. Had the boomers still been fighting they would have destroyed all the followers of Slinky Kid. This was a great turning point in the history of Slinkians.

  <h2> The Book of Dawson; The ExAntiChrist 1.2 — Changes </h2>
  <p> The AntiChrist had taken over with little resistance. It all changed when a search of the promised land revealed the strongest followers of Slinky Kid. The new found Slinkian strength destroyed the power of the AntiChrist. He moved back to following the ways of Slinky Kid. This change of ways was kickstarted by a strange black couch found near the battle site of the chromosome war. The power of Slinky Kid had spread through the land when he sacrificed his chromosome. The AntiChrist moved the couch into the river and was purified of evil. He became a founder and the ExAntiChrist.

  <h2> The Book of Dawson; The ExAntiChrist 1.3 — Rebirth </h2>
  <p> The world can never be so imbalanced as to have only good or only evil. When the AntiChrist was purified it brought imbalance to the world. The good was too strong. It is a sad thing that there can be too much good but there was. The balance was soon to be restored by the new AntiChrist who had secretly been becoming more and more evil. With the new evil arising something needed to be done. No plans had yet been made but a great observation occurred. That observation may prove to be the savior of The Game.

  <h2> The Book of Noah; The ExAntiChrist 2.1 — Observations </h2>
  <p> We could not be so fortunate as to have the new AntiChrist, Noah, not cross the road. It truly was intriguing. As the founders and The Liam were running to The Game with a new disciple Noah followed. The Liam kept running with the new disciple whilst the other founders hid waiting to see what Noah would do. As he neared the road all seemed lost. Suddenly, as if an invisible force was controlling him Noah turned around and left the founders be. This may protect The Game for a long time to come.

  <h2> The Book of Noah; The ExAntiChrist 2.2 — Observations 2 (Oct 10, 2019) </h2>
  <p> Strangely enough nothing new transpired with Noah today. I wonder if he is planning something. I do recall however that Noah acted very strange when invited to the barbecue. It’s probably nothing though.
